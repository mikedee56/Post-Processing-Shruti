- [ ] **Architecture Overview**: Context-aware classification vs primitive replacement
- [ ] **Integration Points**: Minimal changes to existing successful systems

#### **Technical Specifications** (4 minutes)
- [ ] **Context Classification**: Idiomatic vs mathematical vs scriptural contexts
- [ ] **Fallback Strategy**: Robust graceful degradation if MCP unavailable
- [ ] **Performance Targets**: Maintain <2s processing while adding intelligence

#### **Code Integration** (3 minutes)
- [ ] **Current Entry Point**: `src/utils/text_normalizer.py:convert_numbers()`
- [ ] **Proposed Enhancement**: `AdvancedTextNormalizer` with MCP client
- [ ] **Backward Compatibility**: Existing systems continue working unchanged

**Questions for Discussion**:
- Does the MCP approach address the identified quality issues?
- Are there alternative approaches we should consider?
- What concerns do you have about external service dependencies?

  - AdvancedTextNormalizer development and integration
  - Comprehensive test suite with real content validation
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Quality Assurance (Weeks 4-5)
  - Content quality validation and performance optimization
  - User acceptance testing and deployment preparation
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Production Rollout (Week 6)
  - Staged deployment with monitoring and success validation

#### **Resource Requirements** (5 minutes)
- [ ] **Team Structure**: 1.0 FTE developer, 0.5 FTE QA, 0.25 FTE DevOps
- [ ] **Development Time**: 215 hours development, 145 hours QA
- [ ] **Infrastructure**: MCP server access, enhanced development environment

#### **Budget Estimates** (4 minutes)  
- [ ] **Development Costs**: $37,900 total (6-week development cycle)
- [ ] **Infrastructure Costs**: $350-750/month (MCP services + monitoring)
- [ ] **ROI Considerations**: Quality improvement enables academic use cases

**Questions for Discussion**:
- Does the 6-week timeline align with team priorities and availability?
- Are the resource requirements reasonable for this quality improvement?
- How does this fit with other planned development initiatives?

### **Section 4: Risk & Budget Analysis (10 minutes) - Quinn + Team Discussion**

#### **Risk Assessment** (5 minutes)
- [ ] **Overall Risk Level**: Medium-Low with robust mitigation strategies
- [ ] **Primary Risks**: MCP service dependency, integration complexity
- [ ] **Mitigation Strategies**: Fallback systems, staged deployment, comprehensive testing
- [ ] **Risk-Benefit Ratio**: 1:2.1 (Highly Favorable - Benefits outweigh risks)

#### **Budget Deep Dive** (5 minutes)
- [ ] **Development Investment**: Front-loaded costs for long-term quality benefits
- [ ] **Ongoing Costs**: Monthly MCP service fees vs manual correction costs
- [ ] **Quality Value**: Enables academic publication and professional use cases
- [ ] **Scalability Benefits**: Automated quality improvement vs human review

**Questions for Discussion**:
- Are the identified risks acceptable given the mitigation strategies?
- Does the budget align with expected quality improvement benefits?  
- What additional risk factors should we consider?

### **Section 5: Decision Making (10 minutes) - Team Discussion**

#### **Go/No-Go Decision Criteria** (3 minutes)
- [ ] **Quality Impact**: Does this solve a critical content quality issue?
- [ ] **Technical Feasibility**: Is the MCP integration approach sound?
- [ ] **Resource Alignment**: Do we have capacity for 6-week development?
- [ ] **Budget Approval**: Are costs justified by quality improvements?

#### **Decision Options** (4 minutes)
