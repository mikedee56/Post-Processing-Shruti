*process-file "data/raw_srts/lecture_01.srt"

# This will:
# 1. Apply Sanskrit/Hindi corrections
# 2. Run QA analysis
# 3. Generate quality metrics
# 4. Format for academic standards
```

### Example 2: Batch Processing
```bash
# Process entire directory with orchestrated workflow
*batch-process "data/raw_srts/"

# This coordinates:
# 1. Parallel processing of multiple files
# 2. Consolidated QA analysis
# 3. Performance monitoring
# 4. Quality assurance reporting
```

### Example 3: Quality Analysis
```bash
# Run comprehensive QA analysis
*qa-analyze "data/processed_srts/"

# Provides:
# 1. Confidence analysis across files
# 2. OOV detection and clustering
# 3. Anomaly detection results
# 4. Academic compliance scoring
```
