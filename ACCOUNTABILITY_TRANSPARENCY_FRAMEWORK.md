# ACCOUNTABILITY & TRANSPARENCY FRAMEWORK
**Complete Organizational Structure for Stabilization Epic**

## CORE PRINCIPLE: ABSOLUTE TRANSPARENCY

### Zero Tolerance for Hidden Information
- **No surprises**: Every issue, risk, or challenge communicated immediately
- **No optimistic reporting**: Status reports reflect actual reality, not hopes
- **No technical jargon barriers**: All issues explained in business terms
- **No "almost working" claims**: Binary success/failure reporting only
