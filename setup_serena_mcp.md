# Serena MCP Integration with Claude Code

## Setup Completed ✅

The Serena MCP server has been successfully integrated with Claude Code as an external MCP server.

### Configuration

**Claude Code Settings**: `.claude/settings.local.json`
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "serena": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "serena-mcp-server", "--context", "agent", "--project", "D:\\Post-Processing-Shruti"],
      "cwd": "D:\\Post-Processing-Shruti\\serena",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "D:\\Post-Processing-Shruti\\serena\\src"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Serena Tools

When the MCP server is active, Claude Code will have access to these Serena tools:

#### File Operations
- **`read_file`** - Enhanced file reading with language server integration
- **`list_directory`** - Smart directory listing with project context
- **`search_for_pattern`** - Advanced regex search across project files

#### Symbol Intelligence  
- **`find_symbol`** - Language-aware symbol finding across codebase
- **`get_symbols_overview`** - Project-wide symbol analysis
- **`find_referencing_symbols`** - Find all references to symbols

#### Memory & Knowledge
- **`remember_knowledge`** - Store project insights and patterns
- **`recall_knowledge`** - Retrieve stored knowledge contextually

#### Configuration & Workflow
- **`configure_project`** - Set up project-specific settings
- **`switch_mode`** - Change between different operational modes
- **`onboard_project`** - Initialize new project for Serena

### How to Use

1. **Start Claude Code session** - The Serena MCP server will automatically start when Claude Code launches
2. **Access tools naturally** - Claude Code will suggest Serena tools when relevant to your requests
3. **Project-aware operations** - All Serena tools are automatically contextualized to your Post-Processing-Shruti project

### Benefits for Your Workflow

✅ **Enhanced File Operations**: Intelligent file reading and searching across your entire codebase  
✅ **Symbol-Level Analysis**: Language server integration for precise code understanding  
✅ **Knowledge Persistence**: Remember patterns and insights across sessions  
✅ **Multi-Language Support**: Works with Python, YAML, JSON, and other project files  
✅ **No Code Changes Required**: Serena operates as external tooling, no modifications to your post-processing code

### Testing the Integration

The integration is ready to use! Try asking Claude Code to:
- "Search for all uses of SanskritPostProcessor in the codebase"
- "Read the main configuration files and summarize the settings"
- "Find all imports of the text_normalizer module"
- "Remember that the lexicon files are in data/lexicons/ for future reference"
