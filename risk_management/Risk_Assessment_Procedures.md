# RISK ASSESSMENT & ESCALATION PROCEDURES
## MCP Pipeline Excellence - Risk-Minimal Executive Initiative

**Project**: CEO-Approved $185K MCP Pipeline Excellence Initiative  
**Risk Philosophy**: Minimal risk with bulletproof fallback protection  
**Authority**: PM (Sarah) with clear CEO escalation procedures

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **RISK MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY**

### **CEO Risk Tolerance**:
- **"No problem with external dependencies"** - MCP service integration approved
- **"Risk minimal due to existing fallback protection"** - Current system provides safety net
- **"Bulletproof delivery"** - Quality standards cannot be compromised
- **"Budget not an object"** - Resource constraints should not create delivery risk

### **Risk Management Principles**:
1. **Proactive Identification**: Identify risks before they impact delivery
2. **Systematic Mitigation**: Clear procedures for risk reduction and prevention
3. **Graceful Fallback**: Existing system protection prevents catastrophic failure
4. **Rapid Escalation**: Clear procedures for executive awareness and decision-making
