## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a realistic roadmap based on the actual current state where Epic 5 foundation is solid, but Epic 4 needs proper implementation from its current 80% baseline rather than the falsely claimed "PRODUCTION READY" status.

**Critical Success Factor**: Complete Story 4.1 properly (achieve 20/20 test pass rate) before advancing to subsequent stories. The discovered gaps between documentation claims and actual implementation reality must be addressed with rigorous validation at each phase.

**Next Immediate Action**: Begin Story 4.1 gap closure with dedicated focus on the 4 failing tests and missing infrastructure components identified in the architectural forensics analysis.

**Document Status**: Implementation Ready  
**Review Required**: Development team alignment on resource allocation  
**Approval Needed**: Budget authorization for external contractors  
**Start Date**: Upon Story 4.1 gap closure initiation
