## Overview

A sophisticated post-processing system designed to transform ASR-generated transcripts of Yoga Vedanta lectures into highly accurate, academically rigorous textual resources. The system specializes in Sanskrit and Hindi term correction, IAST transliteration standards, and semantic refinement while preserving the authentic intention and style of the original teachings.

### Key Capabilities

- **âœ¨ Lexicon-Based Correction System** (Story 2.1): Advanced Sanskrit/Hindi word identification and fuzzy matching
- **ðŸ§  Contextual Modeling** (Story 2.2): N-gram language models and phonetic pattern matching
- **ðŸ“œ Scripture Processing** (Story 2.3): Canonical verse identification and substitution with IAST formatting
- **ðŸ”¬ Research-Grade Enhancement** (Story 2.4 - In Development): Hybrid matching with sandhi preprocessing and semantic similarity
- **ðŸŽ¯ IAST Transliteration Enforcement**: Academic-standard transliteration with multiple input format support  
- **ðŸ”§ Intelligent Text Normalization**: Context-aware number conversion and filler word removal
- **ðŸ“Š Quality Assurance Framework**: Comprehensive metrics and validation systems
- **âš¡ High Performance**: Optimized for processing 12,000+ hours of lecture content

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Required packages: `pandas`, `pysrt`, `fuzzywuzzy`, `python-Levenshtein`, `pyyaml`

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/post-processing-shruti.git
cd post-processing-shruti
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.post_processors.sanskrit_post_processor import SanskritPostProcessor

# Initialize the processor
processor = SanskritPostProcessor()

# Process an SRT file
input_file = "data/raw_srts/lecture.srt"
output_file = "data/processed_srts/lecture_processed.srt"

metrics = processor.process_srt_file(input_file, output_file)
print(f"Processed {metrics.total_segments} segments with {metrics.segments_modified} modifications")
```

```

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Input Validation**: SRT file parsing and structure validation
2. **Text Normalization**: Filler word removal, number conversion, punctuation standardization
3. **Sanskrit/Hindi Identification**: Lexicon-based term identification with confidence scoring
4. **Fuzzy Matching**: Multi-algorithm matching (Levenshtein, phonetic, partial)
5. **IAST Transliteration**: Academic standard enforcement with multiple input format support
6. **Quality Validation**: Semantic drift detection and integrity checks
7. **Output Generation**: Enhanced SRT with preserved timestamps

## Features

### Story 2.1: Lexicon-Based Correction System

- **Advanced Word Identification**: Identifies Sanskrit/Hindi terms using externalized lexicons
- **Sophisticated Fuzzy Matching**: Multiple algorithms including Levenshtein distance and phonetic matching
- **IAST Standard Compliance**: Converts multiple transliteration formats to academic IAST standard
- **High-Confidence Corrections**: Intelligent correction application with conflict resolution
- **Extensible Lexicon Management**: Version-controlled, validated lexicon system

### Quality Assurance

- **Processing Metrics**: Detailed statistics on corrections applied and confidence scores
- **Validation Framework**: Semantic drift detection and integrity verification  
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with golden dataset benchmarking
- **Logging System**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring

## Configuration

The system uses YAML-based configuration for easy customization:

```yaml
# Example configuration
fuzzy_min_confidence: 0.75
correction_min_confidence: 0.80
iast_strict_mode: true
enable_phonetic_matching: true
max_corrections_per_segment: 10
```
