# 6. User Interface Design Goals

**This section guides future design efforts for the post-processing workflow, even though the MVP is primarily a headless system.**

### 6.1 Overall UX Vision
The UX vision for this project is to provide a user experience that is transparent, authoritative, and efficient. The system will be headless for automated flagging, with an innovative UI for human review. This UI will be designed to enhance functionality for all users, with a structured but non-repetitive workflow that preserves the editor's sanity.

### 6.2 Key Interaction Paradigms
The primary interaction paradigm will be focused on feedback and validation. The system will present information in a clear, structured manner and provide a straightforward way for human reviewers to provide corrections and approval. Key features include:

- **Audio-Synchronized Review**: Editable, timestamped segments that, when clicked, seek the audio to that specific spot and begin playback
- **Domain-Specific Correction Tools**: One-click replacement for fuzzy-matched Sanskrit terms, more efficient than general-purpose tools like Grammarly
- **Collaborative Workflow**: GP editors can easily flag issues for SME review with comments/questions, mimicking a Google Docs-style workflow

### 6.3 Core Screens and Views

#### 6.3.1 Correction Dashboard
A management view showing:
- List of transcripts and their processing status ("Pending Review," "Flagged for SME," "Approved")
- Progress metrics and quality indicators
- Assignment tracking for review workflow

#### 6.3.2 Transcript Review View
An editor-focused interface featuring:
- Structured workflow guiding through flagged sections
- Contextual highlighting of corrections and suggestions
- Expertise-based rating system matching editor skills to content complexity
- Canonical verse selection from standardized sources (IAST compliant)
- No free-form LLM lookup to maintain control and avoid complexity

### 6.4 Design Principles

#### 6.4.1 Accessibility
- **Standard**: WCAG AA compliance minimum
- **Philosophy**: Good design naturally leads to improved functionality
- **Implementation**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, high contrast modes

#### 6.4.2 Branding
- **Style**: Clean, minimalist, and professional
- **Focus**: Content accuracy and readability over visual flourishes
- **Academic Standards**: Consistent with scholarly publication aesthetics

#### 6.4.3 Platform Support
- **Primary**: Web-responsive design
- **Compatibility**: Cross-device access for flexible review workflows
- **Performance**: Optimized for both desktop and tablet usage patterns
