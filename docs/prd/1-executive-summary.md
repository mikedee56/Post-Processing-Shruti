# 1. Executive Summary

The Advanced ASR Post-Processing Workflow is a specialized system designed to transform automatically generated transcripts of Yoga Vedanta lectures into academically rigorous, publication-ready textual resources. The system addresses the unique challenges of processing spiritual discourse containing Sanskrit and Hindi terminology, scriptural references, and technical vocabulary requiring precise transliteration standards.

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Current ASR systems struggle with:
- Misrecognition of Sanskrit/Hindi terms in English lectures
- Inconsistent transliteration of spiritual terminology
- Failure to identify and correct scriptural verse references
- Poor handling of numbers, proper nouns, and filler words in spiritual context

### 1.2 Solution Overview
A comprehensive post-processing pipeline that leverages linguistic expertise, canonical text databases, and specialized NLP models to achieve publication-quality transcript accuracy for Yoga Vedanta content.

### 1.3 Goals and Success Metrics
**Primary Goals:**
* To produce transcripts that are consistent, accurate, and suitable for book publication and video captions
* To provide a reliable and easy-to-use searchable database for research and study
* To transform 12,000 hours of lecture audio into an accessible and credible textual corpus
* To improve standard transcription accuracy criteria, including WER and CER
* All Sanskrit and Hindi terms will adhere to the IAST transliteration standard for consistency and academic rigor

**Success Metrics:**
- **Primary**: 90%+ reduction in Word Error Rate (WER) for Sanskrit/Hindi terms
- **Secondary**: 95%+ accuracy in scriptural verse identification
- **Operational**: Process 100+ hours of content per day
- **Quality**: Human review required for <5% of processed content

### 1.4 Background Context
The existing ASR-generated transcripts for Yoga Vedanta lectures, while achieving high initial accuracy in English, require a specialized post-processing workflow to address significant inconsistencies and misrecognitions. A key challenge is the precise identification and correction of Sanskrit and Hindi terms and scriptural references, which impacts the academic rigor and authenticity of the content. This project aims to solve this problem by developing a multi-phased post-processing solution that will transform raw SRT outputs into a high-quality, publishable resource.
