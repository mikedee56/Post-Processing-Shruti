# 9. Epic Roadmap & Implementation Strategy

### 9.1 Epic Overview

The development approach follows a **MVP Monolith** strategy with progressive complexity across four major epics:

#### Epic 1: Foundation & Pre-processing Pipeline
**Goal**: Establish core processing framework and basic text normalization
**Duration**: 4-6 weeks
**Success Criteria**: Clean, consistent preprocessing with timestamp integrity

#### Epic 2: Sanskrit & Hindi Identification & Correction  
**Goal**: Implement specialized linguistic processing and IAST transliteration
**Duration**: 6-8 weeks
**Success Criteria**: 90%+ reduction in Sanskrit/Hindi term errors

#### Epic 3: Semantic Refinement & QA Framework
**Goal**: Advanced semantic processing and quality assurance systems
**Duration**: 6-8 weeks  
**Success Criteria**: Comprehensive review workflow with <5% human intervention

#### Epic 4: Deployment & Scalability
**Goal**: Production-ready system with performance optimization
**Duration**: 4-6 weeks
**Success Criteria**: Handle 12,000+ hours efficiently with robust monitoring
