# 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance Requirements
- **P1** (NFR2): The system must be able to handle a large volume of data efficiently (e.g., 12,000 hours of audio)
- **P2**: Complete processing within 2x real-time (1 hour audio = 2 hours processing)
- **P3**: Support concurrent processing of up to 10 files
- **P4**: Memory usage <8GB for typical processing loads

### 5.2 Data Integrity Requirements
- **D1** (NFR1): The system must maintain the integrity of the original SRT timestamps
- **D2** (NFR3): The post-processing must preserve the original intention, tone, and stylistic nuances of the Guru's speech
- **D3** (NFR6): The post-processing script must be able to handle conversational nuances such as partial or rescinded phrases, ensuring grammatical correctness while preserving timestamp integrity
- **D4**: Zero data loss during processing failures

### 5.3 Scalability Requirements
- **S1** (NFR4): The system must be scalable to handle future increases in lecture volume
- **S2**: Handle transcript corpus growth to 50,000+ hours
- **S3**: Support lexicon databases with 100,000+ terms
- **S4**: Enable horizontal scaling for processing pipeline

### 5.4 Maintainability Requirements
- **M1** (NFR5): The system must support the use of externalized lexicons (JSON or YAML files) for easy updates and versioning by linguistic experts
- **M2**: Modular architecture for easy updates and extensions
- **M3**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **M4**: Version control integration for all components

### 5.5 Accuracy Requirements
- **A1**: 90%+ reduction in Sanskrit/Hindi term errors
- **A2**: 95%+ accuracy in scriptural verse identification
- **A3**: <2% false positive rate for correction suggestions
- **A4**: 98%+ preservation of original speech meaning and tone
