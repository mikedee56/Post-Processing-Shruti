# Story 2.6: Academic & Format Polish Enhancement

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** post-processing system user,
**I want** the output to meet academic-grade formatting and capitalization standards,
**so that** the transcripts are suitable for scholarly publication and professional distribution.

## Background
Epic 2 (Stories 2.1-2.5) successfully delivers professional-quality output suitable for production use. QA validation identified 591 enhancement opportunities to elevate the output to academic-grade excellence:
- 242 academic formatting opportunities (sentence capitalization)
- 80 spiritual content opportunities (Sanskrit term capitalization)  
- 269 format consistency opportunities (subtitle numbering, spacing)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Academic Capitalization Standards**: Resolve all 242 sentence capitalization opportunities identified in QA validation
2. **Sanskrit Term Standardization**: Polish 80 Sanskrit/Hindi term capitalization instances for consistency
3. **Format Consistency**: Fix 269 format issues including subtitle numbering sequences and spacing
4. **Zero Regression**: Maintain 100% functionality of all existing Epic 2 features (Stories 2.1-2.5)
5. **Pipeline Integration**: Seamlessly integrate enhancements as optional post-processing step
6. **Production Ready**: Generate `*_POLISHED.srt` files suitable for academic distribution
