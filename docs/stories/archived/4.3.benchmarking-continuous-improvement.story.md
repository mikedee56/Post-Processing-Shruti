# Story 4.3: Benchmarking & Continuous Improvement

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** project owner,
**I want** to measure the success of the project and ensure continuous improvement,
**so that** I can provide concrete evidence of the enhancements' effectiveness.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A "golden dataset" of manually perfected transcripts is used to quantitatively measure the script's accuracy improvements (e.g., Word Error Rate reduction on Sanskrit terms).
2. A systematic process is established to incorporate human corrections back into the post-processing script.
3. The system can utilize these corrections to fine-tune linguistic models and expand externalized lexicons.
4. The system provides a mechanism to track and report on automated QA metrics and editor-specific corrections.
