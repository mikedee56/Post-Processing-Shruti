# Story 2.4.4: Cross-Story Enhancement Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Yoga Vedanta transcript processor,  
**I want** system-wide enhancements that improve Stories 2.1 and 2.2 using advanced components from the 2.4.x series,  
**so that** the entire post-processing pipeline benefits from research-grade algorithms with unified confidence scoring and provenance management.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Story 2.1 (Lexicon-based Correction) is enhanced with Sanskrit sandhi preprocessing from Story 2.4.1
2. Story 2.1 fuzzy matching is enhanced with phonetic hashing for 10-50x faster candidate filtering
3. Story 2.2 (Contextual Modeling) is enhanced with semantic similarity validation from Story 2.4.2
4. Story 2.2 contextual rules work across spelling variations using Sanskrit phonetic encoding
5. The system provides unified confidence scoring across all enhanced components (0.0-1.0 normalized)
6. The system implements Gold/Silver/Bronze provenance classification across all lexicon sources
7. All existing functionality in Stories 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 continues to work unchanged
8. Enhanced components include feature flags for graceful fallback to original functionality
9. System-wide performance improvements maintain <2x processing time increase with accuracy gains

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Integration Points
Based on `docs/scripture-enhancement-architecture.md`:

**Component Location**: `src/enhancement_integration/` directory (lines 249-252)
**Integration Strategy**: Cross-story enhancement coordination using enhancement layer pattern (lines 180-200, 392-401)
**Core Purpose**: System-wide improvements affecting multiple stories with unified confidence and provenance

**Story 2.1 Enhancement Opportunities (lines 182-190):**
- **Sanskrit Sandhi Preprocessing**: Handle combined words using sanskrit_parser sandhi splitting
- **Enhanced Fuzzy Matching**: Add phonetic hashing as first-pass filter for 10-50x performance improvement

**Story 2.2 Enhancement Opportunities (lines 192-200):**
- **Semantic Context Validation**: Higher confidence when syntactic (n-gram) and semantic models agree
- **Advanced Phonetic Matching**: Contextual rules work across spelling variations using Sanskrit phonetic encoder

**Unified System Components:**
- **UnifiedConfidenceScorer**: System-wide confidence scoring with 0.0-1.0 normalization (lines 250-251)
- **ProvenanceManager**: Gold/Silver/Bronze classification and weighted confidence (lines 251-252)

**Cross-Story Coordination Requirements:**
- Feature flag-based enhancement control with graceful fallback (lines 287-292)
- Performance target: <2x processing time increase with accuracy improvements (line 55)
- Full backward compatibility across all enhanced stories (lines 51-52)

### Testing
- **Test Location**: `tests/test_cross_story_integration.py` (line 265)
- **Framework**: pytest with cross-story integration fixtures
- **Coverage Focus**: Cross-story enhancement validation, regression testing, feature flag behavior
- **Performance Requirements**: Validate system-wide performance targets and accuracy improvements
- **Critical Tests**: Ensure all Stories 2.1-2.3 functionality works with enhancements enabled/disabled
