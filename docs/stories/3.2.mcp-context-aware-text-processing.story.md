# Story 3.2: MCP-Enhanced Context-Aware Text Processing

## Story
**As a** Yoga Vedanta content processor  
**I want** context-aware number processing that preserves idiomatic expressions while intelligently converting numbers based on context  
**So that** quality issues like "one by one" → "1 by 1" are eliminated while maintaining accuracy for scriptural references and mathematical content

## Status
- **Current Status**: DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION  
- **Assigned**: @dev
- **Priority**: HIGH (Production Quality Issue)
- **Story Points**: 8

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Idiomatic Expression Preservation ✅
- [x] System preserves "one by one", "step by step", "day by day" patterns
- [x] Context classification identifies IDIOMATIC expressions with >85% confidence
- [x] Performance maintained under 2 seconds processing time

### AC2: Context Classification Accuracy 🚨 **CRITICAL BUGS**
- [ ] **BUG**: Temporal processing: "Year two thousand five" → "Year 2005" (currently produces "Year 2000 five")
- [ ] **BUG**: Capitalization consistency: "Chapter two" should remain "Chapter 2" not "chapter 2"
- [ ] Mathematical contexts: "Two plus two equals four" → "2 plus 2 equals 4"
- [ ] Scriptural contexts: "chapter two verse twenty five" → "chapter 2 verse 25"

### AC3: Production Readiness 🚨 **CRITICAL**
- [ ] **BUG**: Remove TODO comments and implement proper MCP stubs
- [ ] **BUG**: Simplify event loop management (lines 340-359 in advanced_text_normalizer.py)
- [ ] Add proper error handling and circuit breaker patterns
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation metrics

### AC4: Test Coverage
- [ ] Unit tests for all context types (IDIOMATIC, MATHEMATICAL, SCRIPTURAL, TEMPORAL)
- [ ] Edge case testing (malformed input, Unicode handling)
- [ ] Error scenario testing (MCP server failures)
- [ ] Integration tests with full processing pipeline

## Tasks/Subtasks

### 🚨 Critical Fixes (HIGH Priority)
- [ ] Fix temporal number conversion bug in `_convert_temporal_numbers()` method
- [ ] Fix capitalization preservation in scriptural contexts
- [ ] Remove production TODO comments and implement proper stubs
- [ ] Simplify async/sync event loop complexity

### 🔧 Quality Improvements (MEDIUM Priority)
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker patterns for MCP server failures
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and fallback metrics
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate sync/async logic

### 🧪 Testing & Validation (MEDIUM Priority)
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite covering all context types
- [ ] Add boundary condition and edge case tests
- [ ] Implement integration tests with existing pipeline
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks and regression tests

## Dev Notes

### Current Implementation Location
- Primary: `src/utils/advanced_text_normalizer.py`
- Config: `config/mcp_integration_config.yaml`
- Validation: `validate_mcp_integration.py`

### Technical Debt Identified by QA
1. **Lines 472-473**: Temporal conversion delegates to parent class incorrectly
2. **Lines 340-359**: Complex event loop management needs simplification
3. **Line 108**: TODO comment in production code
4. **Lines 453-467**: Inconsistent capitalization handling

### Architecture Concerns
- Dual sync/async implementation creates complexity
- Missing proper error boundaries for MCP failures
- No metrics collection for fallback usage rates

## Testing

### QA Test Results (Current Status)
✅ **PASS**: Critical "one by one" preservation functionality  
✅ **PASS**: Performance requirements (<2s processing time)  
❌ **FAIL**: Temporal number conversion accuracy  
❌ **FAIL**: Capitalization consistency  
⚠️ **WARN**: Production readiness (TODO comments, error handling)

### Test Cases Required
```python
# Context Classification Tests
"And one by one, he walked." → "And one by one, he walked." (PRESERVE)
"Chapter two verse twenty five." → "Chapter 2 verse 25." (CONVERT + CAPS)
"Year two thousand five." → "Year 2005." (CONVERT)
"Two plus two equals four." → "2 plus 2 equals 4." (CONVERT)
```

### Performance Benchmarks
- Target: <2.0 seconds processing time
- Current: ~0.005 seconds (EXCELLENT)
- Memory usage: Monitor for event loop leaks

## QA Results

### Senior QA Review (Quinn) - Date: 2025-08-12
**Overall Grade: B+ (Good with Critical Issues)**

**STRENGTHS:**
- ✅ Successfully resolves critical "one by one" quality issue
- ✅ Excellent performance (5ms vs 2000ms target)
- ✅ Well-structured architecture with strong typing
- ✅ Robust fallback mechanisms

**CRITICAL ISSUES - MUST FIX BEFORE PRODUCTION:**
1. 🚨 **HIGH**: Temporal bug - "two thousand five" → "2000 five" instead of "2005"
2. 🚨 **MEDIUM**: Capitalization inconsistency in scriptural contexts  
3. 🚨 **MEDIUM**: Complex event loop management creates stability risk
4. 🚨 **MEDIUM**: TODO comments in production code

**DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATION:**
**CONDITIONAL APPROVE** - Core functionality works and provides immediate quality improvement. Deploy after fixing critical temporal bug and addressing production readiness issues.

**QUALITY GATE:** All HIGH priority issues must be resolved before production deployment.

### Risk Assessment
- **HIGH RISK**: Temporal conversion bug could corrupt production data
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Event loop complexity could cause stability issues under load
