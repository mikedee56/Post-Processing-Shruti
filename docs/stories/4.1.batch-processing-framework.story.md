# Story 4.1: Batch Processing Framework

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** to process large volumes of transcripts efficiently,
**so that** I can handle the full corpus of 12,000 hours of lecture content.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The post-processing script is designed to operate within a robust batch processing framework (e.g., Apache Airflow, custom Python scripts with multiprocessing).
2. The framework includes robust error handling, logging, progress monitoring, and restart capabilities.
3. The system can scale to handle the 12,000 hours of audio efficiently.
