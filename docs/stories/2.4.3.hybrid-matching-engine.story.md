# Story 2.4.3: Hybrid Matching Engine - Core 3-Stage Pipeline

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Yoga Vedanta transcript processor,  
**I want** a comprehensive 3-stage matching pipeline (phonetic → sequence alignment → semantic similarity) for scripture verse identification,  
**so that** the system achieves research-grade accuracy in matching noisy ASR transcripts to canonical scriptural verses.

## Acceptance Criteria
check
1. The system implements a 3-stage matching pipeline: phonetic hashing → Smith-Waterman sequence alignment → semantic similarity
2. The system can filter scripture candidates using Sanskrit-specific phonetic hashing for fast Stage 1 filtering
3. The system can perform Smith-Waterman sequence alignment for Stage 2 precision matching of noisy ASR text
4. The system can compute Stage 3 semantic similarity using iNLTK embeddings from Story 2.4.2
5. The system provides weighted composite confidence scoring combining all three stages
6. The system integrates seamlessly with existing Story 2.3 ScriptureProcessor and maintains full backward compatibility
7. The system handles Gold/Silver/Bronze source provenance classification from research blueprint
8. The system gracefully falls back to existing Story 2.3 functionality if advanced components fail
9. All existing Story 2.3 scripture processing functionality continues to work unchanged
