### üìö QA LESSONS LEARNED

**Critical Discovery: Environment Setup is Key to Accurate QA Assessment**

1. **Virtual Environment Detection**: Always check for `.venv` directory before diagnosing dependency issues
2. **Environment Activation Required**: Python packages must be tested within the configured virtual environment 
3. **Documentation Updates**: High-level docs (CLAUDE.md, README.md) updated to prevent future misdiagnosis
4. **Comprehensive Testing Protocol**: 
   - Check for virtual environment first
   - Activate environment before any testing
   - Set PYTHONPATH for proper imports
   - Run both file validation and functional tests

**Updated QA Protocol for Future Reviews:**
```bash
# 1. Check for virtual environment
ls -la .venv/

# 2. Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# 3. Set Python path
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/project/src

# 4. Run comprehensive tests
python test_story_validation.py
```

**Key Takeaway**: Environment issues can masquerade as implementation problems. Always validate the testing environment before assessing code quality.
