### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: Implementation shows strong architectural understanding of the semantic relationship modeling requirements, with comprehensive method implementations covering all 6 acceptance criteria. However, **critical runtime errors** were discovered and fixed during review. The codebase demonstrates sophisticated semantic analysis concepts but had missing helper methods that would cause immediate failures in production.

- Well-structured relationship data models and visualization tools
- Comprehensive error handling patterns and fallback mechanisms
- Strong performance monitoring and optimization architecture
- Expert validation tools fully implemented with multiple output formats

**Critical Issues Resolved**:
- Missing `_get_term_analysis_sync()` method that was being called throughout the codebase
- Missing `_discover_cross_domain_relationships_sync()` wrapper method
- Async/sync context handling issues that could cause runtime failures

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `src/semantic_analysis/semantic_analyzer.py`
  - **Change**: Added missing `_get_term_analysis_sync()` method (lines 1141-1192)
  - **Why**: Method was referenced throughout the code but not implemented, causing immediate runtime failures
  - **How**: Created synchronous fallback using SimpleNamespace with proper error handling and lexicon integration

- **File**: `src/semantic_analysis/semantic_analyzer.py`

  - **How**: Implemented dictionary-based term associations with generic fallback patterns

- **File**: `src/semantic_analysis/semantic_analyzer.py`
  - **Change**: Added missing `_discover_cross_domain_relationships_sync()` wrapper (lines 1215-1234)
  - **Why**: Synchronous wrapper needed for async method calls in sync contexts
  - **How**: Simple wrapper with comprehensive error handling and structured return format

- **File**: `test_story_3_1_1_validation.py`
  - **Change**: Created comprehensive test suite for all 6 acceptance criteria
