- [x] Quality reports complement existing metrics collection  
- [x] Expert validation integrates with existing review workflows
- [x] Academic output standards maintained and enhanced
- [x] Reporting integration for academic stakeholders

## Technical Tasks

### Task 1: AcademicPolishProcessor Integration
- [x] Analyze existing AcademicPolishProcessor interface
- [x] Implement semantic enhancement hooks in academic pipeline
- [x] Add semantic quality validation to polish workflow
- [x] Ensure backward compatibility with existing polish logic

### Task 2: Enhanced Quality Reporting
- [x] Extend existing metrics collection with semantic quality scores
- [x] Create semantic compliance reporting for academic standards
- [x] Add IAST transliteration accuracy metrics
- [x] Integrate quality trend analysis for academic stakeholders

### Task 3: Academic Stakeholder Interfaces
- [x] Create academic-focused reporting dashboard views
- [x] Implement export functionality for academic publication workflows  
- [x] Add quality assurance summaries for linguistic experts
- [x] Create compliance reports for IAST standards

### Task 4: Review Process Integration
- [x] Integrate semantic validation with existing review workflows
- [x] Add expert validation touchpoints in academic polish pipeline
- [x] Create seamless handoff between automated and manual processes
- [x] Implement quality gate integration for academic output

### Task 5: Academic Standard Compliance
- [x] Add IAST transliteration validation checks
- [x] Implement Sanskrit academic formatting standards
- [x] Create compliance scoring for academic publications
- [x] Add validation for yoga vedanta terminology accuracy

## Dev Notes

**Integration Points:**
- Existing AcademicPolishProcessor in post-processing pipeline
- Current metrics collection and reporting system  
- Established review workflows for academic content
- IAST transliteration standards enforcement

**Dependencies:**
- Story 3.2: Academic Quality Assurance Framework
- Story 3.3: Expert Dashboard and Review System
- Existing AcademicPolishProcessor functionality

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test AcademicPolishProcessor integration
- [ ] Test semantic quality metrics calculation
- [ ] Test academic stakeholder reporting interfaces
- [ ] Test compliance validation logic

### Integration Tests  
- [ ] Test end-to-end academic workflow with semantic enhancement
- [ ] Test backward compatibility with existing polish processor
- [ ] Test reporting system integration
- [ ] Test expert validation workflow integration

### Acceptance Tests
- [ ] Validate academic output quality maintained/enhanced
- [ ] Verify zero regression in existing academic workflows
- [ ] Test stakeholder reporting functionality
- [ ] Validate IAST compliance checking accuracy

## Definition of Done

Semantic quality assurance enhances existing academic workflows without disrupting established processes. Academic stakeholders have improved visibility into processing quality with enhanced reporting and validation capabilities.
