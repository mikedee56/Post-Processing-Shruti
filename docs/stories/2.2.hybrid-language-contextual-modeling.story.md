# Story 2.2: Hybrid Language & Contextual Modeling

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** post-processing script,
**I want** to use contextual clues to improve correction accuracy,
**so that** I can handle complex linguistic nuances.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The system can use n-gram models or rule-based systems to predict the likelihood of a Sanskrit/Hindi word appearing in a given context.
2. The system can correct misrecognized terms by generating phonetic representations of the ASR output and comparing them to phonetic representations of the Sanskrit/Hindi lexicon.
3. The system can apply contextual rules to ensure consistent and correct terminology (e.g., if "karma" is followed by "yoga," ensure it's "karma yoga").
4. The system can handle context-dependent spelling and shortened words, falling back to a more formal, standardized spelling for consistency.

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation quality with professional-grade architecture.** The Story 2.2 contextual modeling system demonstrates sophisticated software engineering with well-designed components, comprehensive configuration management, and robust error handling. All five major components (N-gram Language Model, Phonetic Encoder, Contextual Rule Engine, Spelling Normalizer, and Contextual Enhancement integration) follow consistent architectural patterns with proper separation of concerns.

**Code Architecture Highlights:**
- Clean dataclass-based configuration system throughout all components
- Comprehensive enum-based type safety for algorithms and rule types  
- Proper logging integration with structured error handling
- Well-designed factory patterns and dependency injection
- Extensive use of Python typing for maintainability
- Professional-grade statistical modeling with multiple smoothing techniques

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `src/contextual_modeling/phonetic_encoder.py`

### Security Review

**No security concerns identified.** All components handle input validation appropriately, use safe file I/O operations, and contain no unsafe code patterns. The phonetic encoding algorithms are mathematical/linguistic only with no security implications. Configuration loading uses safe YAML/JSON parsing without eval() or similar unsafe operations.
