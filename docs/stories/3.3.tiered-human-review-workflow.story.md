# Story 3.3: Tiered Human Review Workflow

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** human reviewer,
**I want** to be guided through a clear and efficient review process,
**so that** I can provide accurate corrections based on my expertise.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The system provides a mechanism for a general proofreader (GP) to easily flag issues for a Subject Matter Expert (SME) review, with a line and a comment/question, in a Google Docs-style workflow.
2. The system implements a rating system that matches the editor's level of expertise with the difficulty or complexity of the scripture involved in a particular transcript.
3. The system provides a feedback loop to incorporate human corrections from the review process back into the post-processing script and external lexicons.

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Add reviewer role management and permission system
- [ ] Task 2: Expertise-Complexity Matching System (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create complexity rating system for scriptural content
  - [ ] Build reviewer expertise profiling and skill assessment
  - [ ] Implement intelligent assignment algorithm for transcript-reviewer matching
  - [ ] Add workload balancing and capacity management
- [ ] Task 3: Feedback Integration and Learning System (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create human correction capture and validation system
  - [ ] Build automated lexicon updating from reviewed corrections
  - [ ] Implement post-processing rule refinement based on feedback patterns
  - [ ] Add correction impact tracking and quality metrics

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Epic 2 provides comprehensive automated correction system ready for human feedback integration

Building on comprehensive Epic 2 and Epic 3.1-3.2 architecture:
- **Review Interface**: Web-based collaborative review system with real-time commenting
- **Assignment System**: Intelligent matching of reviewers to content based on complexity and expertise
- **Feedback Integration**: API for capturing human corrections and feeding back to automated systems
- **Quality Tracking**: Enhanced metrics system for measuring human review effectiveness

### Component Specifications
Building on comprehensive Epic 2 and 3.1-3.2 foundation:
- **ReviewWorkflowEngine**: Core system managing the tiered review process
- **CollaborativeInterface**: Web-based review interface with commenting and flagging capabilities
- **ExpertiseMatchingSystem**: Algorithm for matching reviewer skills with content complexity
- **FeedbackIntegrator**: System for incorporating human corrections into automated processes
- **ReviewerManager**: User management system for GP and SME reviewer roles
- **Enhanced LexiconManager**: Integration of human feedback for lexicon improvement
- **Enhanced SanskritPostProcessor**: Learning from human corrections for improved automation

- End-to-end tests for complete GP-to-SME escalation and feedback integration workflows
- User experience tests for review interface usability and efficiency

### Technical Constraints
Based on PRD technical architecture and Epic 2/3.1-3.2 integration:
- Python 3.10+ runtime with web framework (Flask/FastAPI) for review interface
- Integration with comprehensive automated processing systems from Epic 2 and 3.1-3.2
- Real-time collaboration capabilities for multi-reviewer workflows
- Secure authentication and authorization for reviewer role management
- Academic rigor standards for incorporating human expertise into automated systems
- Scalability requirements for supporting multiple concurrent review sessions

### Project Structure Notes
This story completes Epic 3 by building on the comprehensive foundation:
- Leverages Epic 2's complete automated correction system for feedback integration
- Uses Story 3.1's NER capabilities for human validation of entity recognition
- Integrates with Story 3.2's QA flagging to prioritize human review efficiently
- Creates human-AI collaboration loop for continuous system improvement
- Establishes foundation for scalable human review of 12,000+ hours of content

## Testing
- **Test file location**: `tests/test_review_workflow.py`
- **Test standards**: Unit tests for each component, integration tests for collaborative workflow
- **Testing frameworks**: pytest for Python testing, Selenium for web interface testing
- **Specific testing requirements**:
