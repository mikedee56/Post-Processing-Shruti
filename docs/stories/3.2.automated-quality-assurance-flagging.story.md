# Story 3.2: Automated Quality Assurance (QA) Flagging

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** headless system,
**I want** to automatically flag sections that are likely to have errors,
**so that** human reviewers can focus their efforts on the most critical content.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The system can flag sections with unusually low ASR confidence scores.
2. The system can flag sections with a high number of Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words not found in the combined lexicon.
3. The system can identify and flag sudden shifts in language or acoustic properties that might indicate an ASR error.
4. The system can generate a report that highlights potential errors identified by fuzzy matches to prioritize sections for human review.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Implement ASR Confidence Analysis (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create confidence score analysis module for transcript segments
  - [ ] Build statistical analysis for identifying unusually low confidence patterns
  - [ ] Implement configurable confidence thresholds for flagging
  - [ ] Add confidence trend analysis across adjacent segments
- [ ] Task 2: Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) Detection System (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create OOV word detection using combined Epic 2 lexicons
  - [ ] Build OOV density analysis for segment-level flagging
  - [ ] Implement lexicon coverage metrics and reporting
  - [ ] Add unknown word clustering for potential lexicon expansion
- [ ] Task 3: Language and Acoustic Shift Detection (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Develop language pattern analysis for detecting shifts
  - [ ] Create acoustic property change detection algorithms
  - [ ] Implement segment-to-segment continuity validation
  - [ ] Add anomaly detection for unusual linguistic patterns
- [ ] Task 4: QA Report Generation and Prioritization (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create comprehensive QA flagging report system
  - [ ] Build fuzzy match confidence analysis for error prioritization
  - [ ] Implement severity scoring for different types of potential errors
  - [ ] Add human reviewer guidance and recommendations

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Epic 2 provides comprehensive lexicon-based correction, contextual modeling, and verse substitution
- Story 3.1 adds Named Entity Recognition for proper noun identification
- Enhanced SanskritPostProcessor supports multi-layered analysis pipeline
- Existing fuzzy matching system provides confidence scores for potential corrections
- ProcessingResult model tracks quality metrics and correction statistics

### Data Models
Based on PRD data models and previous Epic implementations:
- **TranscriptSegment**: Already includes confidence_score, is_flagged, flag_reason fields [Source: docs/prd/8-data-models.md#TranscriptSegment]
- **ProcessingResult**: Includes quality_metrics object for QA analysis tracking [Source: docs/prd/8-data-models.md#ProcessingResult]
- **New for Story 3.2**: QAFlag, QAReport, OOVAnalysis, ConfidenceAnalysis, AnomalyDetection data structures
- **LexiconEntry**: Used for OOV detection against combined lexicon coverage

### API Specifications
Building on Epic 2 and Story 3.1 architecture:
- **QA Analysis**: Integration with existing processing pipeline for automated flagging
- **Confidence Metrics**: Extension of existing confidence tracking with statistical analysis
- **OOV Detection**: Integration with comprehensive lexicon system from Epic 2
- **Report Generation**: New reporting capabilities for human reviewer workflow preparation

### Component Specifications
Building on comprehensive Epic 2 and 3.1 foundation:
- **QAFlaggingEngine**: Core system for automated quality assurance flagging
- **ConfidenceAnalyzer**: Statistical analysis system for ASR confidence evaluation
- **OOVDetector**: Out-of-vocabulary word detection using combined lexicons
- **AnomalyDetector**: System for detecting language and acoustic shifts
- **QAReportGenerator**: Comprehensive reporting system for human reviewer prioritization
- **Enhanced ProcessingResult**: Extended metrics tracking for QA analysis
- **Enhanced SanskritPostProcessor**: Integration of all QA flagging capabilities

### File Locations

- Performance tests for QA analysis with large-scale document processing
- End-to-end tests for complete QA flagging pipeline and report generation
- Accuracy tests for flagging precision and recall with manually reviewed datasets

### Technical Constraints
Based on PRD technical architecture and Epic 2/3.1 integration:
- Python 3.10+ runtime with statistical analysis libraries (scipy, scikit-learn)
- Integration with comprehensive Epic 2 lexicon system and Epic 3.1 NER capabilities
- Maintain processing pipeline performance with additional QA analysis overhead
- Support for configurable flagging thresholds and severity levels
- Academic rigor standards for QA accuracy in identifying review-worthy content
- Scalability requirements for QA analysis across 12,000+ hours of content

### Project Structure Notes
This story advances Epic 3 by building on the comprehensive foundation:
- Leverages Epic 2's complete lexicon system for comprehensive OOV detection
- Uses contextual modeling and verse substitution confidence metrics for analysis
- Integrates with Story 3.1's NER capabilities for entity-aware QA flagging
- Prepares structured flagging output for Story 3.3's human review workflow
- Adds automated intelligence layer to focus human expertise efficiently

## Testing
- **Test file location**: `tests/test_qa_module.py`
- **Test standards**: Unit tests for each component, integration tests for QA flagging pipeline
- **Testing frameworks**: pytest for Python testing, with statistical accuracy validation
- **Specific testing requirements**: 
  - Test confidence analysis accuracy with precision/recall metrics for flagging
  - Test OOV detection with comprehensive lexicon coverage scenarios
