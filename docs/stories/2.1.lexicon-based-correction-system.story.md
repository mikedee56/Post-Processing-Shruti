# Story 2.1: Lexicon-Based Correction System

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** post-processing script,
**I want** to identify and replace misrecognized Sanskrit and Hindi words,
**so that** the transcript is more accurate and readable.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The system can identify words not found in a standard English dictionary but present in the externalized Sanskrit/Hindi lexicon.
2. The system can use fuzzy matching (e.g., Levenshtein distance) to suggest corrections from the lexicon for near misses.
3. The system can apply high-confidence fuzzy matches to replace the ASR output with the correct transliterated spelling.
4. The system can enforce the IAST transliteration standard for all Sanskrit and Hindi terms in the transcript.
