# Story 4.2: Version Control & Documentation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** project lead,
**I want** to maintain a clear and organized project,
**so that** I can ensure long-term maintainability and collaboration.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Strict version control is implemented for the script, externalized lexicons, and models.
2. The methodology, parameters, and design choices of the project are thoroughly documented.
3. The `docs/` folder contains all the necessary project artifacts, including the PRD, architecture, and epic details.

- [ ] Task 2: Complete Methodology and Design Documentation (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Document complete processing methodology from Epic 1-4
  - [ ] Create comprehensive parameter documentation with rationale
  - [ ] Build design decision documentation with architectural justifications
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting guides and operational documentation
- [ ] Task 3: Organize and Complete Project Documentation (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Validate and enhance existing PRD documentation completeness
  - [ ] Create comprehensive architecture documentation from implemented system
  - [ ] Organize all epic details and story documentation
  - [ ] Add deployment guides and system administration documentation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Complete Epic 1-4 implementation provides comprehensive system for documentation
- All processing components have been developed with extensive configuration systems
- PRD and epic documentation already exists in `docs/prd/` and requires organization
- Story-based development approach provides detailed implementation documentation
- Complex lexicon, model, and configuration systems need comprehensive version control

### Data Models
Based on comprehensive Epic 1-4 implementation:
- **ProcessingConfig**: Comprehensive configuration system requiring versioning [Source: docs/prd/8-data-models.md#ProcessingConfig]
- **LexiconEntry**: Externalized lexicons requiring version control with change tracking
- **New for Story 4.2**: VersionInfo, DocumentationIndex, ChangeLog, ConfigurationHistory data structures
- All Epic 2-3 models (NER models, contextual models) requiring model versioning

### API Specifications
Building on complete Epic 1-4 architecture:
- **Version Management**: System for tracking versions across all components
- **Documentation Generation**: Automated documentation from code and configuration
- **Change Tracking**: Comprehensive audit trail for lexicons and models
- **Deployment Documentation**: Complete guides for system setup and operation

### Component Specifications
Building on complete Epic 1-4 foundation:
- **VersionController**: Comprehensive versioning system for all project artifacts
- **DocumentationGenerator**: Automated documentation generation from implemented system
- **ChangeTracker**: System for tracking and documenting changes across all components
- **ConfigurationManager**: Version-aware configuration management with backward compatibility
- **DeploymentDocumenter**: System for generating deployment and operational guides
- **Enhanced Project Structure**: Complete organization of all documentation artifacts

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure and Epic 1-4 implementation:
- `src/version_control/` - New Version Control and Documentation modules
  - `version_controller.py` - Comprehensive versioning system
  - `documentation_generator.py` - Automated documentation generation
  - `change_tracker.py` - Change tracking and audit trail system
  - `configuration_manager.py` - Version-aware configuration management
- `docs/` - Enhanced and organized documentation structure
  - `architecture/` - Complete system architecture documentation
  - `deployment/` - Deployment guides and operational documentation
  - `methodology/` - Processing methodology and design decisions
  - `api/` - API documentation and component interfaces
  - `troubleshooting/` - Operational guides and problem resolution
- `version_control/` - Version tracking and change management
  - `lexicon_versions/` - Versioned lexicon changes and history
  - `model_versions/` - Model versioning and deployment history
  - `config_versions/` - Configuration version history and migration guides
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Comprehensive project change log
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment and setup guide
- `tests/test_version_control.py` - Test suite for version control functionality

### Testing Requirements
Based on Epic 1-4 comprehensive testing patterns:
- Unit tests for version control system with various versioning scenarios
- Integration tests for documentation generation accuracy and completeness
- Validation tests for version compatibility and backward compatibility maintenance
- Documentation tests for accuracy and completeness of generated guides
- End-to-end tests for complete deployment using generated documentation
- Change tracking tests for lexicon and model version management

### Technical Constraints
Based on comprehensive Epic 1-4 integration and long-term maintenance:
- Python 3.10+ runtime with documentation generation capabilities (Sphinx, mkdocs)
- Git-based version control with comprehensive branching and tagging strategy
- Semantic versioning compliance for all components and dependencies
- Backward compatibility maintenance for existing configurations and lexicons
- Academic documentation standards for methodology and research reproducibility
- Long-term maintainability requirements for 12,000+ hour corpus management

### Project Structure Notes
This story ensures long-term project sustainability by building on complete implementation:
- Documents comprehensive Epic 1-4 architecture and implementation decisions
- Creates version control for all Epic 2-3 lexicons, models, and configurations
- Organizes existing PRD and epic documentation for accessibility and maintenance
- Establishes foundation for collaborative development and system administration
- Ensures academic reproducibility and research methodology documentation

## Testing
- **Test file location**: `tests/test_version_control.py`
- **Test standards**: Unit tests for each component, integration tests for documentation accuracy
- **Testing frameworks**: pytest for Python testing, with documentation validation capabilities
- **Specific testing requirements**: 
  - Test version control system accuracy with lexicon and model versioning scenarios
  - Test documentation generation completeness and accuracy against implemented system
  - Test backward compatibility maintenance with various configuration versions
  - Test deployment documentation accuracy with fresh environment setup
  - Test change tracking system with comprehensive audit trail validation
  - Validate documentation organization and accessibility for long-term maintenance
