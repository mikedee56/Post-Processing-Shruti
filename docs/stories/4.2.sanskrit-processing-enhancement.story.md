- [ ] Add quality validation for ML-suggested lexicon entries
- [ ] Maintain compatibility with existing YAML lexicon format

### AC3: Research-Grade Accuracy Improvement ðŸŽ¯
- [ ] Achieve measurable 15% Sanskrit processing accuracy improvement
- [ ] Implement academic validation standards for Sanskrit transliteration
- [ ] Add research-grade quality metrics and reporting
- [ ] Validate improvements against golden dataset benchmarks

### AC4: System Integration Compatibility ðŸ”—
- [ ] Seamless integration with Story 2.1 SanskritHindiIdentifier
- [ ] Maintain compatibility with Story 4.1 MCP infrastructure
- [ ] Preserve existing API contracts and system interfaces

- [ ] Create transformer-based confidence scoring for Sanskrit terms

### Task 2: Enhanced Lexicon Intelligence (AC2)
- [ ] Extend LexiconManager with ML confidence scoring and feedback loops
- [ ] Implement dynamic lexicon expansion with quality validation
- [ ] Add ML-suggested entry validation and academic review workflow
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing YAML lexicon structure

### Task 3: Accuracy Measurement and Validation (AC3)
- [ ] Implement 15% Sanskrit accuracy improvement measurement system
- [ ] Create academic validation standards for IAST transliteration quality
- [ ] Add research-grade quality metrics and comprehensive reporting
- [ ] Validate improvements using golden dataset benchmarks and academic standards

### Task 4: System Integration Testing (AC4)
- [ ] Create comprehensive integration tests with Story 2.1 foundation
- [ ] Validate compatibility with Story 4.1 MCP infrastructure
- [ ] Test existing API contract preservation and backward compatibility
- [ ] Create end-to-end validation of enhanced processing pipeline

## Implementation Details

### Primary Files
- `src/sanskrit_hindi_identifier/enhanced_lexicon_manager.py` - ML-enhanced lexicon
- `src/utils/mcp_transformer_client.py` - NEW: Transformer integration
- `src/utils/sanskrit_accuracy_validator.py` - NEW: Academic validation
- `src/utils/research_metrics_collector.py` - NEW: Research-grade metrics

### Integration Points
- Extends Story 2.1 SanskritHindiIdentifier with ML enhancements
- Builds on Story 4.1 MCP infrastructure foundation
- Maintains compatibility with existing post-processing pipeline

### Performance Requirements
- Processing time: <1 second (maintain Story 4.1 baseline)
- Accuracy improvement: +15% Sanskrit term recognition and correction
- Quality gates: No regression in existing functionality
- Reliability: Graceful fallback if transformer services unavailable

## Dev Notes

### Story Dependencies
- âœ… Story 2.1 (Sanskrit/Hindi Identifier) - OPERATIONAL
- ðŸ”„ Story 4.1 (MCP Infrastructure Foundation) - IN DEVELOPMENT
- ðŸ“‹ Academic Consultant contractor required for validation

### Technical Integration
- Leverages proven Story 2.1 lexicon management patterns
- Builds on Story 4.1 MCP client infrastructure
- Extends existing fuzzy matching with transformer-based semantic understanding

### Academic Standards
- IAST transliteration compliance validation
- Research-grade accuracy measurement and reporting
- Academic consultant review workflow for ML-suggested improvements

## Estimated Timeline
**Duration**: 2 weeks (Week 3-4)  
**Team**: Dev Lead + ML/AI Specialist contractor + Academic Consultant (starting Week 3)  
**Parallel**: Runs parallel with Story 4.5 (Track B Academic Excellence)
