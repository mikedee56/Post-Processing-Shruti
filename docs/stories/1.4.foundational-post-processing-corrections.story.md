# Story 1.4: Foundational Post-processing Corrections

## Status
completed

## Story
**As a** human reviewer,
**I want** the transcripts to have basic errors corrected automatically,
**so that** I can focus my efforts on more complex issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The script successfully normalizes punctuation, including consistent spacing after periods
2. The script accurately converts spoken numbers into their digital format (e.g., "two thousand five" to "2005")
3. The script identifies and removes common English filler words (e.g., "um," "uh") from the transcript
4. All corrections made by this process maintain the integrity of the original SRT timestamps
5. The script handles and corrects conversational nuances such as partial or rescinded phrases, ensuring grammatical correctness where possible

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,000
This verse, you know, actually this verse talks about the eternal nature of the soul.
```

**Output**: SRT file with foundational corrections applied
```srt
1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Today we will explore the Bhagavad Gita chapter 2 verse 25.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,000
