# Story 3.1: Yoga Vedanta Named Entity Recognition (NER)

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** post-processing script,
**I want** to identify and correctly capitalize proper nouns,
**so that** the transcript is more readable and accurate.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The system can train or adapt an NER model to identify proper nouns specific to Yoga Vedanta (e.g., "Patanjali," "Himalayas").
2. The system uses the externalized lexicon to correctly capitalize these proper nouns in the transcript.
3. The NER model can be expanded to include new proper nouns as needed.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Develop Yoga Vedanta NER Model (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create domain-specific training data for Yoga Vedanta proper nouns
  - [ ] Build or adapt existing NER model for Sanskrit/Hindi proper noun detection
  - [ ] Implement entity classification for different proper noun categories (persons, places, texts, concepts)
  - [ ] Add confidence scoring for named entity predictions
- [ ] Task 2: Lexicon-Based Capitalization System (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Integrate NER model with existing lexicon system from Epic 2
  - [ ] Create proper noun capitalization rules and patterns
  - [ ] Implement context-aware capitalization logic
  - [ ] Add validation system for capitalization accuracy
- [ ] Task 3: Expandable NER Model Management (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create system for adding new proper nouns to training data
  - [ ] Implement incremental model retraining capabilities
  - [ ] Build proper noun suggestion system for unknown entities
  - [ ] Add model versioning and rollback capabilities

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Epic 2 is complete with sophisticated lexicon-based correction, contextual modeling, and verse substitution
- LexiconEntry model already includes is_proper_noun flag for capitalization handling
- Enhanced SanskritPostProcessor supports multi-layered processing pipeline
- Contextual modeling from Story 2.2 provides foundation for entity disambiguation
- Existing fuzzy matching can help with proper noun variant detection

### Data Models
Based on PRD data models and Epic 2 implementations:
- **LexiconEntry**: Already includes is_proper_noun field for proper noun identification [Source: docs/prd/8-data-models.md#LexiconEntry]
- **TranscriptSegment**: processing_metadata can track NER entity annotations [Source: docs/prd/8-data-models.md#TranscriptSegment]
- **New for Story 3.1**: NamedEntity, EntityCategory, NERModel, ProperNounRule data structures
- **ProcessingResult**: Extended to track proper_nouns_corrected, ner_confidence_average metrics

### API Specifications
Building on Epic 2 comprehensive architecture:
- **NER Integration**: Extension of existing post-processing pipeline with entity recognition
- **Entity Classification**: Integration with lexicon system for proper noun categorization
- **Model Training**: New capabilities for domain-specific NER model development
- **Capitalization Rules**: Enhancement of existing text normalization with proper noun handling

### Component Specifications
Building on Epic 2 foundation:
- **YogaVedantaNER**: Core NER model specifically trained for Yoga Vedanta domain
- **EntityClassifier**: System for categorizing different types of proper nouns
- **CapitalizationEngine**: Rule-based system for applying proper noun capitalization
- **NERModelManager**: Management system for NER model training and updates
- **Enhanced LexiconManager**: Extended to handle proper noun databases and training data
- **Enhanced SanskritPostProcessor**: Integration of all NER capabilities

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure from Epic 2:
- `src/ner_module/` - New Named Entity Recognition modules
  - `yoga_vedanta_ner.py` - Domain-specific NER model
  - `entity_classifier.py` - Entity categorization system
  - `capitalization_engine.py` - Proper noun capitalization logic
  - `ner_model_manager.py` - Model training and management
- `src/sanskrit_hindi_identifier/` - Enhanced modules
  - `lexicon_manager.py` - Extended for proper noun training data
- `src/post_processors/` - Enhanced post-processing
  - `sanskrit_post_processor.py` - Integrate NER capabilities
- `data/ner_training/` - NER training data and models
  - `proper_nouns_dataset.yaml` - Yoga Vedanta proper noun training data
  - `entity_categories.yaml` - Entity classification schemas
  - `trained_models/` - Saved NER model files
- `config/ner_config.yaml` - Configuration for NER model and capitalization rules
- `tests/test_ner_module.py` - Test suite for NER functionality

### Testing Requirements
Based on Epic 2 testing patterns and NER-specific needs:
- Unit tests for NER model accuracy with known Yoga Vedanta entities
- Integration tests for capitalization engine with existing lexicon system
- Validation tests for entity classification across different proper noun categories
- Performance tests for NER processing with large document volumes
- End-to-end tests with complex proper noun scenarios and edge cases
- Model accuracy tests with precision/recall metrics for domain-specific entities

### Technical Constraints
Based on PRD technical architecture and Epic 2 integration:
- Python 3.10+ runtime with NLP libraries (spaCy, transformers, or similar) for NER
- Integration with existing Epic 2 lexicon-based correction and contextual modeling
- Maintain timestamp integrity during proper noun capitalization operations
- Support for incremental model training without full reprocessing
- Academic rigor standards for proper noun accuracy in Yoga Vedanta domain
- Performance requirements for real-time NER processing in production pipeline

### Project Structure Notes
This story begins Epic 3 by building on the comprehensive Epic 2 foundation:
- Leverages existing lexicon system with is_proper_noun flags from Stories 2.1-2.3
- Uses contextual modeling from Story 2.2 for better entity disambiguation
- Integrates with established processing pipeline and configuration management
- Adds semantic layer for proper noun recognition and capitalization
- Prepares foundation for QA and human review workflows in Stories 3.2-3.3

## Testing
- **Test file location**: `tests/test_ner_module.py`
- **Test standards**: Unit tests for each component, integration tests for NER processing pipeline
- **Testing frameworks**: pytest for Python testing, with NER-specific accuracy metrics
- **Specific testing requirements**: 
  - Test NER model accuracy with precision/recall metrics for Yoga Vedanta entities
  - Test capitalization engine with various proper noun scenarios and edge cases
  - Test entity classification across different categories (persons, places, texts, concepts)
  - Test model expansion capabilities with new proper noun additions
  - Test integration with existing Epic 2 correction and contextual systems
  - Validate processing performance impact of NER analysis on pipeline throughput
