## Implementation Details

### Primary Files
- `src/utils/performance_optimizer.py` - NEW: Performance optimization engine
- `src/monitoring/system_monitor.py` - NEW: Enterprise monitoring system
- `src/monitoring/telemetry_collector.py` - NEW: Telemetry and metrics collection
- `src/utils/reliability_manager.py` - NEW: Reliability and error handling
- `config/monitoring_config.yaml` - NEW: Monitoring configuration
- `config/performance_thresholds.yaml` - NEW: Performance baseline configuration

### Integration Points
- Builds on Story 4.1 MCP infrastructure foundation
- Enhances Story 4.2 Sanskrit processing with performance optimization
- Integrates with existing Story 2.1-3.2 processing pipeline

### Performance Targets
- Processing time: <1 second (current baseline: 0.002s, maintain excellence)
- Uptime: 99.9% with graceful fallback protection
- Memory usage: Efficient management with leak detection
- Throughput: Handle production load with consistent performance

## Dev Notes

### Story Dependencies
- 🔄 Story 4.1 (MCP Infrastructure Foundation) - IN DEVELOPMENT
- 🔄 Story 4.2 (Sanskrit Processing Enhancement) - READY FOR DEVELOPMENT
- 📋 Requires completion of both Track A Week 1-4 foundations

### Architecture Notes
- Enterprise-grade reliability patterns built on proven MCP foundation
- Comprehensive monitoring extends existing logging infrastructure
- Performance optimization maintains existing sub-millisecond excellence

### Quality Gates
- All performance targets must be met before Story 4.4 integration
- 99.9% uptime validation required for production readiness certification
- No regression in existing functionality allowed

## Estimated Timeline
**Duration**: 2 weeks (Week 5-6)  
**Team**: Dev Lead + ML/AI Specialist contractor  
**Prerequisites**: Stories 4.1 and 4.2 completed and validated
