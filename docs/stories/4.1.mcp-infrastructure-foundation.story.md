- Performance telemetry collection
- Graceful degradation strategies
```

**2. MEDIUM PRIORITY: Enhanced Context Classification**
From `_classify_number_context_enhanced()` analysis - needs expansion:
- Current: 4 basic types (IDIOMATIC, MATHEMATICAL, SCRIPTURAL, TEMPORAL)
- Target: 8 enhanced types (add EDUCATIONAL, ORDINAL, NARRATIVE)
- Implement confidence scoring for classification decisions

**3. TESTING COVERAGE GAPS**
Current test coverage is strong but missing:
- Integration tests with Story 2.1 Sanskrit/Hindi identifier

### Refactoring Performed
**No refactoring performed** - Implementation quality is enterprise-grade and follows proper architectural patterns.

### Critical Issues Requiring Resolution

#### 🚨 **HIGH PRIORITY - AC2 Context Processing Fixes**

**Issue 1: Temporal Number Processing**
```python
# CURRENT (FAILING):
"Year two thousand five" -> "Year two thousand five" ❌

# REQUIRED:  
"Year two thousand five" -> "Year 2005" ✅
```

**Issue 2: Scriptural Capitalization Consistency**
```python
# CURRENT (INCONSISTENT):
"Bhagavad Gita chapter three verse ten" -> "Bhagavad Gita Chapter 3 verse 10" ❌

# REQUIRED:
"Bhagavad Gita chapter three verse ten" -> "Bhagavad Gita chapter 3 verse 10" ✅
```

**Root Cause Analysis**: Enhanced context classification is operational, but the conversion methods need refinement for compound temporal numbers and consistent capitalization rules.

### Compliance Check
- ✅ **Coding Standards**: Excellent - Enterprise patterns throughout
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Perfect - Files follow established structure  
- ✅ **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive - 6 test classes with 400+ lines
- ❌ **All ACs Met**: 3/4 passed - AC2 context processing needs completion

### Security Review
**✅ SECURE** - No security concerns identified. All processing is defensive and academic content focused.

### Performance Considerations  
**✅ EXCEPTIONAL** - Performance exceeds requirements by wide margin:
- Target: <1 second per operation
- Achieved: ~0.0001 seconds (10,000x faster than requirement)

### Improvements Checklist

#### Critical Fixes Required (AC2):
- [ ] **Fix temporal number processing**: Implement compound "two thousand + number" patterns
- [ ] **Fix scriptural capitalization**: Ensure consistent lowercase "chapter/verse" handling  
- [ ] **Validate enhanced context classification**: Ensure 8 context types working correctly
